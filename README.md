# NewtonCG
Implementation of Newton-CG algorithm with backtracking line-search, for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as a `torch.optim.Optimizer`. 
CG refers to the conjugate gradient method, which is the optimizer's sub-problem solver.
Refer to `example.ipynb` for an example use case. 
The `NewtonCG` optimizer is found in `newton_cg.py`.
